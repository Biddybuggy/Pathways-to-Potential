    <h1>Program Components</h1>
    <h2>Portable Stalls</h2>
    <p>These mobile stalls will serve as both a classroom and a food stall. We will use portable, lightweight, and eco-friendly stalls made from recycled materials. The stall will be equipped with foldable tables, tools, and used chairs, and colorful branding to attract participants and the community. The stalls will rotate between high-demand areas in Jakarta, ensuring accessibility to undeserved regions.</p>
    <h2>Educational Workshops</h2>
    <h3><b>Our curriculum will include the following:</b></h3></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic concepts of entrepreneurship and simple money management tailored for street children</li>
        <li>Hands-on workshops teaching how to sell food, crafts, and provide basic services</li>
        <li>Counseling to help them work on their communication skills and develop their strategic thinking and emotional needs</li>
        <li>Real-life application: The team will help participants in selling our food or crafts in the stalls while we teach them practical concepts of entrepreneurship, gaining hands-on experience under mentor supervision. (e.g. They may learn how to count money, speak to customers, how to market their product at low costs, etc)
        </li>
        <li>Participants receive a certificate upon completion of the program</li>
    </ul>
