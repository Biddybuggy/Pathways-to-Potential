    <p>These mobile stalls will serve as both a classroom and a food stall. We will use portable, lightweight, and eco-friendly stalls made from recycled materials. The stall will be equipped with foldable tables, tools, and used chairs, and colorful branding to attract participants and the community. The stalls will rotate between high-demand areas in Jakarta, ensuring accessibility to undeserved regions.</p>
