    <p><i>There's so much I've learned through this program -- like how to manage money, which I used to think was so difficult, and how to figure out ways to break even. We also learned how to communicate with customers effectively. I used to just observe and buy things as a customer, but now I realize how challenging the world of business truly is. It has opened my eyes and made me more confident to try new things. -Rumah Kita Student</i></p>

    <p><i>At first, I was really shy, but after joining this program, I became much more confident. I realized that making money isn't easy at all, but now I know how to do it and feel even more motivated to try again in the future. -Rumah Kita Student</i></p>
