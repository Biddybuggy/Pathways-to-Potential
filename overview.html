    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Street children in Indonesia, especially in Jakarta, have become an inevitable phenomenon. The mapping surveys of street children in 12 major cities conducted in 1999 by the Center for Societal Development Studies at Atma Jaya Catholic University, commissioned by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA), estimated that the number of street children in 12 largest cities in Indonesia was 39,861.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Despite various programs offering basic education to these children, the current approach often lacks practical, hands-on training that addresses real-world challenges. Pathways to Potential is a transformative initiative designed to empower street children in Jakarta by equipping them with entrepreneurship skills and real-life business experience. By using pop-up stalls, which can be converted into both classrooms and food stalls, the program combines mentorship, hands-on learning, and income-generating opportunities to break the cycle of poverty.</p>
