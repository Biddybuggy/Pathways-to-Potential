    <h1>Pathways to Potential</h1>
    <h2>Unlocking Opportunities & Empowering Success</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Street children in Indonesia, especially in Jakarta, have become an inevitable phenomenon. The mapping surveys of street children in 12 major cities conducted in 1999 by the Center for Societal Development Studies at Atma Jaya Catholic University, commissioned by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Ministry of Social Affairs (MOSA), estimated that the number of street children in 12 largest cities in Indonesia was 39,861.</p>
    <p> Despite various programs offering basic education to these children, the current approach often lacks practical, hands-on training that addresses real-world challenges. Pathways to Potential is a transformative initiative designed to empower street children in Jakarta by equipping them with entrepreneurship skills and real-life business experience. By using pop-up stalls, which can be converted into both classrooms and food stalls, the program combines mentorship, hands-on learning, and income-generating opportunities to break the cycle of poverty.</p>
    <h3>Our Objectives</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Give street kids hands-on experience in financial literacy and entrepreneurship.</li>
        <li>Encourage independence by applying business principles in practical settings.</li>
        <li>Establish pathways for long-term income generation and employability.
        </li>
        <li>Promote inclusivity and social impact through partnerships with local businesses and organizations.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Program Components</h3>
    <h4>Portable Stalls</h4>
    <p>These mobile stalls will serve as both a classroom and a food stall. We will use portable, lightweight, and eco-friendly stalls made from recycled materials. The stall will be equipped with foldable tables, tools, and used chairs, and colorful branding to attract participants and the community. The stalls will rotate between high-demand areas in Jakarta, ensuring accessibility to undeserved regions.</p>
    <h4>Educational Workshops</h4>
    <p><b>Our curriculum will include the following:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic concepts of entrepreneurship and simple money management tailored for street children</li>
        <li>Hands-on workshops teaching how to sell food, crafts, and provide basic services</li>
        <li>Counseling to help them work on their communication skills and develop their strategic thinking and emotional needs</li>
        <li>Real-life application: The team will help participants in selling our food or crafts in the stalls while we teach them practical concepts of entrepreneurship, gaining hands-on experience under mentor supervision. (e.g. They may learn how to count money, speak to customers, how to market their product at low costs, etc)
        </li>
        <li>Participants receive a certificate upon completion of the program</li>
    </ul>
